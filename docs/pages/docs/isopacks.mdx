# Isopacks

**Isopacks** are add-on modules for Isoflow that contain icons and other assets that can be loaded with the Isoflow editor.  You can easily extend Isopacks or build your own from scratch.

### Standard Isopacks

Two Isopacks are included as part of the npm package.  Both sets of icons are available under the MIT license:
1. **[The Basic Isopack](https://github.com/markmanx/isoflow/tree/main/src/isopacks/basic/icons)** includes a set of generic isometric icons (for example, cube, pyramid and block).
<div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markmanx/isoflow/main/src/isopacks/basic/icons/cube.svg" alt="drawing" width="100"/>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markmanx/isoflow/main/src/isopacks/basic/icons/pyramid.svg" alt="drawing" width="100"/>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markmanx/isoflow/main/src/isopacks/basic/icons/block.svg" alt="drawing" width="100"/>
</div>
2. **[The Networking Isopack](https://github.com/markmanx/isoflow/tree/main/src/isopacks/networking/icons)** includes a set of isometric networking icons (for example, server, storage and switch).
<div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markmanx/isoflow/main/src/isopacks/networking/icons/server.svg" alt="drawing" width="100"/>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markmanx/isoflow/main/src/isopacks/networking/icons/storage.svg" alt="drawing" width="100"/>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markmanx/isoflow/main/src/isopacks/networking/icons/switch.svg" alt="drawing" width="100"/>
</div>

## Loading the Networking Isopack
This will enable the standard set of networking icons within the Isoflow editor.

```jsx showLineNumbers
import Isoflow from 'isoflow';
import { networkingIsopack } from 'isoflow/dist/isopacks';

const initialScene = {
  icons: networkingIsopack,
  nodes: [],
  connectors: [],
  rectangles: [],
}

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }}>
      <Isoflow initialScene={initialScene} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Combining Isopacks

You can combine multiple Isopacks together using the `mergeIsopacks` method.

```js
import { networkingIsopack, basicIsopack, mergeIsopacks } from 'isoflow/dist/isopacks';

const mergedIsopacks = mergeIsopacks(basicIsopack, networkingIsopack);

const initialScene = {
  icons: mergedIsopacks,
  nodes: [],
  connectors: [],
  rectangles: [],
}
```

### Icon IDs

As a convention, the `id` of an Isopack icon should be the same as the icon's SVG filename (without the `.svg` extension).
This makes it easy to derive `id`s from the file structure (see the links to the Isopacks [above](#standard-isopacks)).

## Static assets

While you can import all icon images directly from the npm package (as shown above), it is recommended that you host the icon images yourself so that they can be lazy-loaded (referencing them via URL from a service like S3 or a CDN).

```js {6}
{
  icons: [
    {
      id: 'server',
      name: 'Server',
      url: 'https://isoflow.io/static/assets/icons/networking/server.svg',
      collection: 'Networking'
    }
  ]
}
```

### Benefits of lazy-loading vs importing icons

- **Importing icons** directly from the npm package adds to the final bundle size. Users will have to download *all* assets in the Isopack before your app loads (which can be a problem if there are a lot of icons).

- **Referencing icons via URL** enables the icons to be downloaded later on, after the app loads. This also activates the browser's cache for individual icons so that they can be loaded instantly later on.
